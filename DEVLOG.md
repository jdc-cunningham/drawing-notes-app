crap sleep again

I want to start using this thing "dog food" and part of that is an onscreen keyboard... since I think the Linux one is hard to trigger

It'll be fun too, to make a keyboard

But yeah... I keep reaching to draw on something but I sold my remarkable 2! Sad...

This has a benefit of real-time sync but RM2 is capable of that as well

Downside of a foldable laptop like this is it's janky... like keyboard/mousepad is still active with this Manjaro Arch setup I'm running.

Probably something you can configure/setup but already other problems... also using a tiny 13" screen like this is like self torture when if I look up 12" there is a 32" ultrawide monitor above it

But... I bought it/wanted the tiny sleek red laptop... so here we are

What I'm having a problem with at the moment, the SO example code works but I don't know what's the proper way to deal with fast changing states

Oh man my neck

1:33 PM

for real idk if I can work on this long term looking down at this laptop
